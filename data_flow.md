our ecommerce database enables a merchant to create a brand, the respective category the brand falls under and to add products. Variations in color and size, create variety for the diverse pool of customers we serve. Creating Product items enables us to see in real time how much product is available, we can then use this as an incentive to buyers, hurry while stocks last! 
# 2. Price Calculation flow. 🟰
   ![priceoverride](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa4632c5-4cd0-44d3-9398-ae3fefd36ec3)
Our ecommerce database enables the merchants to adjust their prices whenever they choose ie clearance sale, addition of a limited edition item that is so special and so rare to get your hands on. Oh and bundle deals 3 for $10, what a steal!...you get the gist. Price override clearly identifies which items have special pricing and which items are available at the base_price.
# 3. Inventory management. 🚛
![inventory management](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fea7bb9-d3c5-4d88-9649-db01581e4b1a)
Our database enables real time inventory management. The world has changed and a just-in-time inventory system exhibits that. If inventory supply is dwindling, reorders are added to keep giving the customers what they want!
